            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>Physiotherapists often use goniometers to measure joint range of motion (R.O.M.) in their patients.
                However, this manual process can be time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we
                designed Physmate, a mobile app that offers an easy and accurate way to measure and record R.O.M data.
            </p>

            <p>Physmate is a smart goniometer app that utilizes the sensors on modern smartphones to measure joint
                movement accurately. It generates detailed reports that simplify the recording process for
                physiotherapists. With our app, therapists can save valuable time that would have been spent taking
                manual measurements and focus more on providing care to their patients.</p>

            <p>In this case study, I will take you through our design process and how we created an intuitive and
                effective solution for physiotherapists.</p>


            <h2>Scope & Constraints</h2>

            <p>Physmate was a UX design project completed as part of the Interaction Design program at Conestoga
                College. Our team of 5 students had 5 weeks to design a prototype for a physiotherapy application. The
                scope of our project was limited to the design phase, including research, ideation, prototyping, and
                testing.</p>

            <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

            <div class="grey-textbox">
                <p><b>What I did:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted user interviews and did empathy mapping.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated with Prasanna on user flows and wireframes.</li>
                    <li>Designed and created high-fidelity mock-ups and the final prototype.</li>
                    <li>Presented the final design to stakeholders along with Prasanna and Alex.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>I was privileged to work alongside a highly capable team, consisting of Prasanna, Alex, Deepti, and
                Mubeen. Together, we conducted extensive research, including user interviews, secondary research, and
                competitive analysis. We met regularly to discuss our findings and plan our next steps.</p>

            <p>As we moved into the prototype phase, we divided responsibilities. Prasanna and I worked on wireframes,
                while Deepti and Mubeen focused on branding and user testing. I then took on the responsibility of
                creating high-fidelity mockups and the final prototype. Meanwhile, Alex, Deepti, and Prasanna worked on
                compiling research, creating the stakeholder presentation, and the design process book.</p>

            <p>Throughout the project, we maintained open communication and assisted each other as needed. Our team had
                excellent synergy, and everyone contributed 100% effort to the project. Finally, Prasanna, Alex and I
                presented our design to the stakeholders.</p>


            <h2>The Problem</h2>

            <p>Through the interviews we conducted with practicing physiotherapists, we learnt about one of their
                biggest pain points:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Physiotherapists constantly need to juggle between assessing the patient and noting down the
                    measurements and readings from the assessment.</li>
                <li>Later, they have to spend a considerable amount of time compiling and organizing this data into
                    reports, often requiring them to stay late to complete paperwork.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Based on these research insights, we defined the problem statement.</p>

            <img src="img/physmate/Problem-Statement.png" class="no-round" width="100%"
                alt="Dr. Erica, a busy physiotherapist needs to record quantitative data regarding her patients’ recovery. But, it takes away too much of her time because she records and compiles the data manually.">

            <h2>Users and Audience</h2>

            <p>The primary users of Physmate are physiotherapists, who are responsible for helping people affected by
                injury, illness or disability through movement and exercise, manual therapy, education and advice.</p>

            <img src="img/physmate/persona-erica.png" class="grey-border" width="100%"
                alt="User Persona - Dr. Erica, a physiotherapist.">

            <p>Secondary users include patients who will benefit from the efficient assessment and treatment process
                provided by Physmate. The audience for this product includes physiotherapy clinics and hospitals where
                physiotherapy is practiced.</p>


            <h2>Research</h2>

            <p>In order to gain a deeper understanding of the problem space and user needs, we conducted various
                research activities. Our research focused on identifying the pain points of physiotherapists,
                understanding the needs of physiotherapy patients, and analyzing the competitive landscape of existing
                mobile apps in the physiotherapy space.</p>

            <h3>Research Methods</h3>

            <p>To gather insights, we used the following methods:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Interviews with Physiotherapy Patients and Practitioners:</strong> We conducted in-depth
                    interviews with 5 physiotherapy patients and 2 practicing physiotherapists to understand their
                    experiences, pain points, and needs. We asked open-ended questions and encouraged them to share
                    their thoughts and feelings about the physiotherapy process.</li>

                <li><strong>Online Research:</strong> We did online research to gain an understanding of how
                    physiotherapy works in Ontario, the regulations around the practice, and the challenges faced by
                    patients and practitioners.</li>

                <li><strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> We analyzed the mobile apps available in the physiotherapy
                    space to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and features.</li>

                <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> We conducted user testing with our prototype to gather feedback and
                    insights from potential users.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Key Research Insights:</h3>

            <h4>Pain points for physiotherapists:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The need to constantly juggle between assessing patients and documenting data</li>
                <li>The time-consuming nature of creating reports based on assessment data</li>
                <li>Late-night work hours due to paperwork overload</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Other Important Insights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Passive range of motion is a key indicator of a patient's progress.</li>
                <li>Patients who have a better understanding of their treatment and progress are more likely to do their
                    at home exercises and recover faster.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>

            <p class="grey-textbox">Physmate stands out from the rest as it offers a solution for use by
                physiotherapists in clinics.</p>

            <p>In order to validate the technical feasibility of our design and identify our niche, we examined various
                top physiotherapy apps in the market. Most of the apps focused on offering exercise programs for remote
                physiotherapy, with some providing self-assessment tools for patients to send to physiotherapists. We
                identified two products that were similar enough to our app to be considered as competitors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b><a href="https://www.mirarehab.com/product/">Mira</a></b><br>
                    A gamified video physiotherapy exercise tool that allows for video range of motion assessments to be
                    done.<br>
                    * Requires additional sensors.</li>

                <li><b><a href="https://www.exer.ai/">Exer</a></b><br>
                    An at-home physiotherapy tool that uses Augmented Reality for patient self-assessment.<br>
                    * Requires correct camera placement.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, these products do not specifically target physiotherapists as their primary users. Physmate, on
                the other hand, offers a solution specifically designed for use by physiotherapists in clinics. This
                sets us apart from our competitors and gives us our niche in the market. We believe that this market is
                underserved and we can provide great value to professionals in the field.</p>

            <h3>Technology Validation through Secondary Research</h3>

            <p>To validate our app's technical feasibility, we conducted secondary research that led us to two relevant
                research papers:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6505893/">'Reliability and validity of
                        clinically accessible smartphone applications to measure joint range of motion: A systematic
                        review'</a></li>

                <li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1934148214002147">'Mobile Smartphone
                        Applications for Body Position Measurement in Rehabilitation: A Review of Goniometric Tools'</a>
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p>These research papers concluded that smartphone-based digital goniometers are accurate enough to replace
                standard goniometers used by clinicians. The research, conducted on a range of devices, indicates that
                most modern smartphones have this capability. The review also confirmed a competent development team can
                create this tool without proprietary software, using only device hardware.</p>


            <h2>Design Process</h2>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>To generate ideas for the Physmate app, we conducted brainstorming exercises like Crazy 6s and 3-panel
                sketching.</p>

            <h3>Crazy 6s</h3>
            <p>During Crazy 6s, we generated multiple ideas, critiqued each other's proposals, and selected the most
                promising ones to proceed with.</p>
            <img src="img/Physmate/crazy6.jpg" width="100%" alt="Crazy 6 sketches">


            <h3>3-Panel Sketches</h3>
            <p>We then used 3-panel sketching to further develop and refine our ideas.</p>
            <img src="img/Physmate/3panel.jpg" width="100%" alt="3 Panel Sketches with dot voting.">

            <h3>Idea Convergence</h3>
            <p>Finally, we used dot voting to converge on the most promising idea to take forward for the design
                process.</p>
            <img src="img/Physmate/idea-convergence.png" width="100%" alt="Idea Convergence Sketches">

            <h3>User Flows</h3>
            <p>To ensure an intuitive user experience, we created user flows for Physmate. We began by mapping out the
                primary user journey, which involves the physiotherapist logging in, selecting the patient and the body
                part they wish to assess, performing the assessment, and generating a report. We then created secondary
                user flows to cover any additional features, such as adding new patients and reviewing previous
                assessments. By creating user flows, we were able to identify potential pain points in the user journey
                and make adjustments to create a more streamlined experience.</p>
            <img src="img/Physmate/User-Flow.png" width="100%" alt="User Flow Diagrams">

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>We designed the information architecture of Physmate to be intuitive and easy to navigate. We began by
                identifying the primary features of the app, such as the ability to select a patient, select a body
                part, and perform an assessment. We then organized these features into a logical hierarchy to ensure
                that users can quickly and easily find what they need. We also included clear labels and icons to aid
                navigation and ensure a seamless user experience.</p>
            <img src="img/Physmate/information-architecture.png" width="100%" alt="Information Architecture">

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>Using the information architecture as a guide, we created wireframes for Physmate. We began with
                low-fidelity wireframes to explore different layout options and ensure that the primary features of the
                app were included.</p>
            <img src="img/Physmate/wireframes.png" width="100%" alt="wireframes">

            <h3>Test Early, Test Often (User Testing 1)</h3>
            <p>At this stage, we heeded our professor's advice to “test early, test often”. We recognized the importance
                of conducting user tests early on in the design process to identify areas of improvement and iterate
                quickly.</p>

            <p>To conduct our usability tests, we enlisted the help of a physiotherapist to participate in the study. We
                used medium-fidelity wireframes to gather feedback. The physiotherapist provided valuable insights that
                we had not considered before, such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The importance of tracking both active and passive range of motion in patient assessments, with
                    passive ROM being crucial in assessing progress.</li>

                <li>The difficulty of taking notes while assisting patients with their assessments, and the subsequent
                    challenge of compiling those notes into a report.</li>

                <li>The effectiveness of sending progress reports to patients to motivate them to continue their
                    recovery journey.</li>

                <li>The industry standard scales used to measure pain levels.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To validate these insights, we spoke with another physiotherapist and discovered that the pain point of
                taking notes and compiling patient progress reports was indeed a big problem.</p>

            <p>These insights were incredibly valuable to us as we moved forward with the design process, and helped us
                to improve the focus of the Physmate app.</p>

            <h3>Iterations based on user feedback</h3>
            <p>After receiving feedback from physiotherapists during our usability test, we realized that our initial
                focus on providing patients with self-assessment tools was not the most pressing need.</p>

            <p>To make improvements early on in the design process, we decided to make some iterations to our problem
                statement and focus on providing a platform for physiotherapists instead of patients.</p>

            <p>To generate new ideas, we conducted a Crazy 6 exercise and 3-panel brainstorming session. Afterward, we
                iterated on the wireframes based on the feedback we received.</p>

            <p>As a result of this iteration phase, we shifted our primary user focus to physiotherapists. Our app was
                now designed to provide tools to physiotherapists to help them be more efficient in their work.</p>


            <h3>Visual Design</h3>

            <p>During the visual design phase, our team worked meticulously to develop a brand identity for Physmate
                that would resonate with the healthcare industry while evoking a soothing emotional response. We
                carefully curated a color palette comprising of various shades of green and infused it into our logo and
                user interface. These colors not only align with the healthcare industry but also evoke a sense of calm
                and tranquility.</p>

            <p>Moreover, we ensured that our design was accessible to all users by following the Web Content
                Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) AA standards. We gave special consideration to text sizes, contrasts,
                and colors to ensure that our design was easily readable by everyone. Although we were not able to
                achieve the AAA compliance, we made sure to incorporate the best possible color mix to enhance
                accessibility.</p>

            <h2>Final Design</h2>

            <p>After several iterations based on user feedback, we have finalized the screen mockups for PhysMate. These
                mockups showcase the different features and functionalities that we have incorporated into the app.</p>

            <p>The main focus of the app is to provide physiotherapists with tools to manage their patients' recovery
                journey. The mockups show how the app allows physiotherapists to create and manage patient profiles,
                conduct assessments, track progress, and assign exercises.</p>

            <img src="img/Physmate/Hi-Fidelity Screens 2.png" width="100%" alt="hi-fi screens 1">

            <h2>User Testing 2</h2>
            <p>After finalizing the prototype, we conducted user testing to ensure the app was intuitive, user-friendly,
                and met the needs of both physiotherapists and patients. We conducted three usability tests and gained
                valuable insights into the user experience.</p>

            <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hidden “Take New Assessment” page: Participants had to click through multiple pages to reach the
                    core feature of the app. We need to make this feature more accessible.</li>

                <li>The “Add a New Patient” feature was not immediately clear to users, as the icon alone did not
                    effectively convey its meaning. To improve this, we could consider adding a more prominent button or
                    label for this feature.</li>

                <li>User flow: A user flow that allows assessments to be done first and assigned to patients later
                    should be added.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Outcomes and Lessons</h2>
            <p>Our team has learned a lot from this project, and we are proud of the outcomes we achieved. Here are some
                of the key outcomes and lessons we learned:</p>

            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We developed a platform that provides a more efficient and user-friendly way for physiotherapists to
                    manage their patients' recovery progress.</li>

                <li>Our app provides patients with a way to monitor their progress, set goals, and stay motivated
                    throughout their recovery journey.</li>

                <li>We incorporated a soothing color palette and followed accessibility standards to ensure our design
                    is inclusive and user-friendly.</li>

                <li>We conducted multiple rounds of user testing and made iterations to our design based on feedback to
                    ensure the app meets the needs of both physiotherapists and patients.</li>

                <li>Our app has the potential to improve the recovery journey for patients and make the process more
                    efficient for physiotherapists.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Overall, we are proud of the outcomes we achieved and the lessons we learned throughout this project. We
                believe that PhysMate has the potential to make a positive impact on the recovery journey of patients
                and improve the efficiency of physiotherapists' work.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Looking ahead, there is still much potential for PhysMate to continue evolving and meeting the needs of
                both physiotherapists and their patients. One possibility is to allow patients to track their progress
                and stay motivated through the app, providing a more comprehensive approach to their recovery journey.
                Additionally, incorporating remote consultation and booking features could benefit patients in remote
                areas or those with mobility challenges.</p>

            <p>We are proud of the progress we have made so far, and the valuable insights and feedback we have received
                from users throughout the development process. With continued dedication and innovation, we believe that
                PhysMate can make a real difference in improving the lives of both physiotherapists and their patients.
